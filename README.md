### Colour
I chose to make this e-store in blue and green shades. These colours were chosen due to it being a bit different than the online book-stores where i live (sweden), and due to blue being appealing to the eye. The reason for the combination of the two was that it would help this store to differentiate itself from other similar stores, chich mostly use red or some shade of blue (for example royal blue). Another reason for my choice was the fact that the blue colour (according to, among others, the website [colour-meanings](https://www.color-meanings.com)) symbolices security and trust, and green symbolices harmony and safety. All the colour choices was checked in [accessibility checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/color-contrast-checker/)'s contrast checker.

## Credits
### Code
A lot of the backend code is based on the [boutique ado](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) project from the Code Institute fullstack developer course.

For the frontend I used the [Shop item template](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-item), and the [Shop Homepage](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage) from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com). The first one is used for the specific items, and the second one is for the shop page.

### Content and Media
All pictures of the books are taken by me, and information about who wrote and published the book can be found on the [live site]() on each book's product page.
