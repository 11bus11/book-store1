# E-shop - Book store
This is a store i created for my 5th project in the Code Institute Software Development Course. It is a simple book store with a small selection of books. It is called Dino's book store, after my cat. 

## UX - User Experience
### User Stories
Site user:
- Easily use and understand the website.
- Create account where they can see previous purchases.
- See products available. Including status and options.
- Add products to cart.
- Search for products.
- Navigate categories and get relevant results.
- Pay for products.

Admin user:
- Add/edit/remove products.
- See and cancel orders.
- Change stock numbers.

### Colour
I chose to make this e-store in blue and green shades. These colours were chosen due to it being a bit different than the online book-stores where i live (sweden), and due to blue being appealing to the eye. The reason for the combination of the two was that it would help this store to differentiate itself from other similar stores, chich mostly use red or some shade of blue (for example royal blue). Another reason for my choice was the fact that the blue colour (according to, among others, the website [colour-meanings](https://www.color-meanings.com)) symbolices security and trust, and green symbolices harmony and safety. All the colour choices was checked in [accessibility checker](https://www.accessibilitychecker.org/color-contrast-checker/)'s contrast checker.

### Structure and typography 

#### Structure
I chose to create a simple structure, since the products are the thing that should attract attention. All products have a green background in the photos. This is so that they fit into the colour-palette while also attracting attention. Right below the navigation bar there is a darker field telling the user the name of the page. 

The base of the website is a simple navigation-bar with dropdown menues for products and accounts. These menues are in a main dropdown-menue on the mobile version. I chose to place the search bar at the top of the dropdown menue for the products. In the mobile version it is at the top of the main dropdown menue. 

#### Typography
I chose to use the font "Rubik Bubbles" for the store name and main page titles. For everything else I used the font "Istok Web". Both of these are from [Google Fonts](). The fonts are also san-serif, which is easier to read on a screen than serif fonts.

The reason I chose these fonts were that they worked well with the colour palette. "Rubic Bubbles" is a softer font that also draws attention. "Istok Web" is inconspicous while also telling the user that effort was put into the website.

## Features
### Shop
The products in the shop can be shown based on their categories or the user can choose to show all the products in alphabetic order. When all products in a category is show they are sorted alphabetically by default. 

There is also a search bar where users can find products.

#### Product card
A product card is created for each product found on the database. Each card shows an image. Either a specific product image, or if none is found, a placeholder image telling the user that there is no product image. They also show the name of the product, the author and the price. There is also some buttons. One for opening the product details (for more information, see "products details", one for adding to cart and one for adding to wishlist. The last two buttons has some logic to them that tells them what they should show, and if they should be shown at all. The "add to cart" button changes to an "out of stock" card if the stock number is below 1, and the wishlist button only shows if the user is logged in.

#### Product details
When the user clicks on the button to get more information about a product, a page showing the information for the specific product opens. It shows the product image to the left, and all the other information about the product to the right. Below the pruduct information is the "add to cart"/"out of stock" (depending on the stock numbers), and "add to wishlist" buttons.

### Bag

### Checkout

### Articles
The articles work similarly to the products. A preview of each article is shown on the articles page, and when the user click on an article they are sent to a page with the full article. The preview contains the title, the author, an introduction of the article (first paragraph) and a "read more" button. The page with the full article shows an image at the top (if there is one), the title, author and full article.

### Messages

### Admin
The admin can add, edit and remove products thru the admin page. They input all the info about the books and then they show up in the category chosen. If needed they can also add more categories. The same goes for the articles.

### Potential Features
- If I had the time I would expand on the sorting options and other features making it easier for the user to find the right product.
- I would also want to expand on the admin features. For example, make it possible to answer incoming messages in the admin window.

### Device Testing
The website was natively tested on these devices:
- Acer Aspire 5
- 1440p monitor (hooked up to a tower pc)


The website was also tested on these devices thru Mozilla Dev Tools:
- Ipad
- 

### Browser Testing
The website was tested on these browsers:
- Mozilla Firefox
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- DuckDuckGo (mobile)

### Peer Review

### Validator Testing

### Manual testing
- Tested the models by creating instances. This was to make sure the fields looked like they should and that everything worked as expected.
- Tested if the database and the frontend was propperly connected by trying to show part of the data in the frontend. 
- Made sure the search bar works by searching for words found in book titles, descriptions, languages and authors. The expected results were showed.

### Software Testing
#### JavaScript Testing - Jest

#### Python Testing

### Bugs
#### Fixed Bugs
- I had a bit of trouble getting the product view to work. The products would not show up on the website. I solved it when i realised the problem was caused by a spelling error. After i fixed the spelling, it all worked as expected. I later had a similar problem when i implemented the ability to filter by category. The first letter in the category needed to be upper-case, which i had forgotten.

#### Unfixed bugs

## Credits
### Code
A lot of the backend code is based on the [boutique ado](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1) project from the Code Institute fullstack developer course. The code is adapted to fit my project.

For the frontend I used the [Shop Homepage](https://startbootstrap.com/template/shop-homepage) from [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com). It is used for the navbar and footer, as well as for the product cards.

### Content and Media
All pictures of the books are taken by me, and information about who wrote and published the book can be found on the [live site]() on each book's product page. The description for the books also tells the user where the description was copied from.
